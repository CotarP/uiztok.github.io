Clean optical laboratory
------------------------
Both optical setups are placed in the clean optical laboratory (ISO 6) together with modular platform for development of medical diagnostic technologies to ensure controllable and adaptable measurement environment. Small preparation lab is included as well to enable final modification of the samples before optical measurements. 

Tech details:  
• flow-based clean room of 48 square meters with HEPA air filtration (ISO 6 class)  
• 3 optical platforms (2PE STED mwFLIM, FMS+OT, modular platform for the development of photonics technologies)  
• standard technical lines (water, pressurized air, nitrogen, CO2, Ar)  
• sample storage and freezer  
• large set of optical components and tools  
• SoP for sample transfers and people flow  
• NFC access control

Clean chemical and cell laboratory
----------------------------------
Standardly equiped cell laboratory is placed in a clean room (ISO4/5) to ensure the most controllable environment to seed and grow cell lines. In addition, chemical clean laboratory (ISO5) is placed nearby to ensure the most efficient hadnling during preparation and basic characterization of the samples. Finally, on the end of the air flow of the clean rooms, there is nano laboratory (ISO 6) for handling and modification of nanomaterials as well as to clean the glass materials and sample holders.  

Tech details:  
• 3 flow-based clean rooms of total 58 m2 with HEPA air filtration (from ISO4/5 to ISO 6 class)   
• Standardly equiped clean cell laboratory (ISO4/5) with several incubators, laminar flow box, ultracentrifuge, deep freezer and small equipment   
• Standardly equiped clean chemical laboratory (ISO 5) with UV-VIS and FTIR spectrometers, centrifuges, pH-meters, mixers, shakers, fridges, small equipment, chemical boxes and extensive working surface  
• Nano clean laboratory (ISO 6) with two fume hoods, sonicators, rotational evaporators, autoclaves, washing machines and Vitrocell cloud aerosolization system  
• standard technical lines (water, pressurized air, nitrogen, CO2, Ar)  
• sample storage and freezers  
• extensive collection of spin and fluorescent probes  
• SoP for sample transfers and people flow  
• code access control
