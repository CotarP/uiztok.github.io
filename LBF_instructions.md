How to edit this website
========================

Some of the pages use the content specified directly within the .md files in the _pages directory:
* about
* applications
* resources
* contact

To edit these, simply modify the text using the markdown styling (see /pages/markdown.md). The header within the -- symbols contains the metadata used to generate the page, so don't modify that. 

Other pages are generated from individual files within the relevant folders:
* _team
* _news
* _publications
* _research
* _teaching  

To proceed with editing those:
1. Copy one of the existing files and rename it.
1. Modify the metadata in the header within --.
1. Adapt the content below -- using markdown styling.
1. Do not modify the content within curly brackets \{ \} - this is part of the code that generates pages.
